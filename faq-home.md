> **Thank you!** We have been overwhelmed by those who have taken the time with so many kind messages and comments following our email to all our users advising of our sad closure of Accountz.com Ltd.
>
> Here are just a few of the questions that have been raised along with our responses:

### What will happen to my version of Home Accountz V3?

Nothing will change. Home Accountz V3 will continue to work as it always has as a desktop application, just licence free. There is no need to look for an alternative solution. Just please install the updates!!!!

### Will Home Accountz V3 make local backups to my computer?

Home Accountz V3 has always made backups every 30 minutes whilst using the application and again upon closure. This will remain the same. The default location for backups are: 

- Windows:   
  `C:\Program Files\Home Accountz v3\BAK`
- Windows 64Bit:   
  `C:\Program Files(x86)\Home Accountz v3\BAK`
- Mac:  
  `/Applications/Home Accountz v3/BAK`

### Can I change the default backup location?

Yes, you can change the backup path by going to Help > About > Arguments > backup-dir and entering the backup location here.  
**PLEASE NOTE, If you remove the external drive / memory stick you may have it configured to, the backups will fail!**

### Can I use an alternative backup solution?

Many people have asked about OneDrive / Dropbox / Time Machine etc. Historically we’ve had users use these solutions on an auto-sync basis and it’s corrupted the files. We know you’ll want to find an alternative to our online backup but please make sure you configure your settings of these solutions to avoid corruption of your files.  But don’t ask us to do this for you!

### Why should I make manual backups?

We have recommended that all users make periodic manual backups to an external device. This is to protect your data from time to time from computer failure.

### How often should I make manual backups?

This is entirely up to you. It really is a question of how much data could you be prepared to lose if you have a computer failure! Once a week / once a month……

### What will happen to the online backup service?

The Online backup service will cease completely on 16/07/2021 and all data held on our servers will be deleted in the week commencing 19/07/2021. After these dates, you will not have access to the service or any of the data previously stored there.

### Will the Accountz Mobile App still work?

As this is all part of the Online Services subscription, again, this synchronisation will cease on 16/07/2021 and all data held on our servers will be deleted in the week commencing 19/07/2021. After these dates, you will not have access to the service or any of the data previously stored there.

### Can you recommend alternative software?

This is a difficult one! Especially after we spent a couple of years developing an amazing online product and had to shelve it after surveying our customers who, too many of which were unwilling to pay a subscription. Every user has had different requirements and used different elements of our software. There are many solutions out there at different price points. However, there is no reason to stop using Home Accountz though! We have given the software away for free and it’s going to be picked up by a former employee and become Open Source (not affiliated with Accountz.com)
